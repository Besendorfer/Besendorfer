# Call me TJ

**TL;DR:** I ship software (web, mobile, backend, data, and AI) using whatever tools get the job done *now*, not whatever I liked last year. 

---

I’m a pragmatic software engineer who values clean code, but values **shipping** more. I’m comfortable moving fast, changing direction, and throwing things away if it leads to better outcomes.

---

## What I Build

* Full‑stack web apps
* Mobile apps
* Backend systems & APIs
* Data workflows
* AI‑driven products and developer tooling

---

## How I Work

* Pragmatic over dogmatic
* Flexible on languages and frameworks
* Leverage > perfection
* Bias toward bleeding‑edge when it helps

I don’t default to TypeScript anymore. I default to *fit for purpose*.

---

## AI

I’m deep into AI‑assisted and agent‑based development.

Current stack (until it isn’t):

* Claude Code CLI
* Zed
* AWS Bedrock / AgentCore / Strands
* LangFuse

Still hands‑on, actively testing how much of the loop agents can own.

---

If you like building useful things quickly, and aren’t married to a stack, we’ll probably get along.
