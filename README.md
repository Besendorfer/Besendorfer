# Call me TJ

**TL;DR:** I ship software (web, mobile, backend, data, and AI) using whatever tools get the job done *now*, not whatever I liked last year.

I’m a pragmatic software engineer. I like clean code, but I care more about shipping. I’m comfortable moving fast, changing direction, and throwing things away if it leads to better outcomes.

I work across full‑stack web, mobile apps, backend systems, data workflows, and AI‑driven products and developer tooling. I like being close to the actual problem, wherever that lives.

I’m flexible on languages and frameworks, biased toward leverage over perfection, and willing to use bleeding‑edge tech when it helps. I don’t default to TypeScript anymore; I default to whatever works (or potentially best) for the task.

I’m deep into AI‑assisted and agent‑based development. Current tools (until they aren’t): Claude Code CLI, Zed, AWS Bedrock / AgentCore / Strands, and LangFuse. Still very hands‑on, but actively testing how much of the development loop agents can realistically own.

If you like building useful things quickly, and aren’t married to a stack, we’ll probably get along.
