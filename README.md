## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! It is currently in the process of being overhauled. Feel free to look around; just know that it may not be fully up-to-date or as robust as I'm hoping it will be in the near future.

Bio: My name is Teancum Besendorfer, but please call me TJ. I like to get things done right the first time. This can, of course, spiral into perfectionism, so a balance is necessary. I'm fascinated with both functional and reactive programming. I love delighting users, whether those users are an application's user, or a developer using a tool.
